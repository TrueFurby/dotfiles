TODO
====
+ fix running/last command in window title
    - use cmd before expansion
    - show more than one word
    - this works correctly in bgnotify
+ display info on connections through *ssh*
    - check `SSH_*` env vars
    - show client connection
    - put info to terminal title as well
+ hide clock in `RPROMPT` from *mc*
    - now it's printed in the beginning,
    because has only single row
    - find way to detect that
